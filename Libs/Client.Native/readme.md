This is a nuget package containing native libs for SysDVR Client.
Using a nuget package is a workaround to force net core into automatically copying and loading dependencies from the runtimes folder

The repo doesn't contain binaries anymore, they're populated by CI when building.
If you want to build locally copy the dlls manually in the binaries folder.
