This is an experimental sysmodule that allows capturing the running game output to a pc via USB or network connection.\
Before opening issues make sure to read the full readme, the tips and commmon issues sections in particular.

## Features/Limitations
- **Video quality is fixed to 720p @ 30fps with h264 compression (hardware limit)**
- Audio quality is fixed to 16bit PCM @ 48kHz stereo. Not compressed
- **Only works on games that have video recording enabled** (aka you can long-press the capture button to save a video)
- Video and audio are two different streams, they're likely to desync as they require two different player instances. Vlc does support a secondary audio stream but i didn't manage to get it working properly.
- Only captures game output. System UI, home menu and homebrews running as applet won't be captured
- Video feed is not realtime, there will always be a minimum of ~1 second of delay.
- Stream quality depends heavily on the environment, bad usb wires or low wifi signal can affect it significantly.
- USB streaming is not available when docked
- Requires firmware >= 6.0.0

Clearly with these limitations **this sysmodule doesn't allow "remote play" and does not fully replace a capture card**.

## Usage
### Setting up the sysmodule
Before continuing make sure you're using latest version of atmosphere (other CFWs should work but I won't provide support for them)

Two versions are provided in the [Releases tab](https://github.com/exelix11/SysDVR/releases):
- `SysDVR.zip` is the "full" version, can stream using both modes and comes with an homebrew app to switch between them
- `SysDVR-USB-Only.zip` will only stream via USB but uses less memory and should run alongside multiple sysmodules.

You should use the full version unless you have specific requirements.\
Download one of the builds and extract it in the root of your sd card, the zips already contain the correct file structure.\
If you added the module with the console on, you will need to reload your CFW for the new module to be loaded. This can normally be accomplished by rebooting from the Power menu.

**By default SysDVR will stream over network**, to switch between modes and set the default one you can use the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.

To play the stream [mpv player](https://mpv.io/) is recommended as it's the most straight forward to set up, any other player that supports raw h264 streams via tcp or stdin should work but you may have to configure it manually.
### Network streaming
This is the easiest way to stream, in this mode the sysmodule is completely standalone.\
Open a terminal (cmd on windows) in mpv's directory and run `mpv tcp://<switch ip address>:6666 --no-correct-pts --fps=30 ` for video and `mpv tcp://<switch ip addr>:6667 --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000` for audio.\
When using network streaming it's not recommended to stream both audio and video at the same time as it may cause slowdowns.\
*In general network streaming has more lag and delay compared to USB, it is worth the time to set it up, especially for gameplay recording.*
### USB streaming
To stream via usb you need the UsbStream program, it's built using .NET core and is compatible with linux as well.\
First of all you should make sure to install [.NET core 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) on your pc, then proceed to setup the drivers, this step is needed only the first time:
#### Driver setup on windows
On windows you may get the `device not found` or `platform not supported` errors or very bad performance on the stream, in this case you may have the wrong driver set up.\
Plug your switch in the computer **while running SysDVR in USB mode** and launch [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) install the `libusb-win32` driver for the "Nintendo Switch" device. **Before installing make sure the target device USB ID is `057e 3006`**, if it's different the sysmodule may not be running, try waiting a bit (it should start around 20 seconds after the console boot) or check again your setup.\
This won't interfere with other applications that communicate with the switch via usb as this sysmodule uses a different product id.
#### Driver setup on linux 
On linux you may have errors about loading the `libusb-1.0` library, this happens when the file name is different than the one expected by dotnet, you can make a symlink as described on the [LibUsbDotNet repo](https://github.com/LibUsbDotNet/LibUsbDotNet#linux-users):\
`sudo find / -name "libusb-1.0*.so*"` and then
```
cd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
sudo ln -s libusb-1.0.so.0 libusb-1.0.so
```
(Example commands, change the paths with the one you find on your pc)
#### Streaming
Most Windows users can simply use UsbStreamGUI, it will allow you to select the streaming mode and launch UsbStream directly.\
\
Linux users will have to use the UsbStream command line interface (Note that this is available on windows too and provides a few more options compared to UsbStreamGUI)\
Launch UsbStream like this:
`UsbStream video <streaming mode> <arg> audio <streaming mode> <arg>` \
These are valid streaming modes: 
- `stdin` : pipes the received data directly to a video player via stdin, this will use no caching so you'll have low delay but it may lag. This will likely require you to provide the args to pass to the player, you can do so like this: `video stdin <player executable> args "<args list>"`
- `mpv` : same as `stdin` but will automatically set up the args for mpv so it just requires the path
- `tcp` : opens a tcp server so players can connect to it and use their own caching mechanism to remove or reduce lag (at the price of an higher delay)
- `file` : writes the received data directly to a file so it can be converted to a common format later.

When using `mpv` the arg is the path of mpv on your pc (use the .com file on windows), you have to repeat it twice if using both streams. \
The `tcp` option requires a free port number and the `file` option the output file path. \
To disable a stream just omit the name and its fields.

Example commands:
```
UsbStream audio mpv C:/programs/mpv/mpv : Plays audio via mpv located at C:/programs/mpv/mpv, video is ignored
UsbStream video mpv ./mpv audio mpv ./mpv : Plays video and audio via mpv (path has to be specified twice)
UsbStream video tcp 1337 audio file C:/audio.raw : Streams video over port 1337 while saving audio to disk
```
Launching UsbStream without any parameter will display more options and examples.\
To connect to the tcp streams you can use: `mpv tcp://localhost:<video port> --no-correct-pts --fps=30 ` for video and `mpv tcp://localhost:<audio port> --no-video --demuxer=rawaudio --demuxer-rawaudio-rate=48000` for audio
## Tips
To get the most out of this sysmodule you will have to do some testing to find configuration that works best for you, here are some tips and useful information:
- If the video stream doesn't start immediately try moving the camera around in the game, to display something the video player needs to acquire a video keyframe first.
- An usb 3 wire is slightly better than usb 2, but both should work.
- Quality also depends on the cpu utilization of the game you're running, OC can improve performances.
- Using cache *will* reduce lags at the cost of an higher delay, for mpv it's on by default (except when using usb stream with `mpv` mode), if you want to try without it the command line arg for mpv is `--cache=no --cache-secs=0`. There's a lot of room for experimenting here, try different values to find the combination that works best for you.
- If using no caching when the screen goes full black or white (eg loading screens) it may cause some desync and the stream will start to drop frames, eventually it will fix by itself but it could take some time, the fastest solution is to open the home menu for a few seconds and then resume the game, for usb stream you can try setting the `--desync-fix` flag (this will introduce glitches).
## Common issues
**When using Usbstream Gui on windows launching UsbStream results in a file not found error** \
Some users had this issue [#20](https://github.com/exelix11/SysDVR/issues/20) , a workaround is to export the batch file from the GUI and edit it in notepad to launch `mpv.com` instead of just `mpv`, will be fixed in the next update. 

**After copying the sysmodule to the sd atmosphere won't boot anymore** \
This happens if you have too many sysmodules or ones particulary heavy like sysftpd, remove them to launch SysDVR.\
If you really need other sysmodules at the same time you can try using the USB-Only version as it uses less memory (512K vs 3MB)\
To remove SysDVR delete the `/atmosphere/contents/00FF0000A53BB665` folder, to remove other sysmodules if you're not sure about the right ID delete the whole `/atmosphere` folder and download a fresh copy of atmosphere.

**Homebrews using USB like GoldLeaf or nxmtp won't launch anymore**\
This is because the USB interface is being used by SysDVR, if you're using the full version you can swith streaming modes using the SysDVR Settings homebrew included in the zip.

**When using network stream there's a lot of delay or it increses over time**\
Mpv will use a cache buffer to avoid lag when the connection drops some packets but this increases delay, you can disable it by using `--cache=no --cache-secs=0`

**The video is laggy or there are a lot of glitches** \
Make sure the connection between the console and your pc is good enough, if streaming via network move both closer to the router or switch to LAN, for USB try using an higher quality wire.
