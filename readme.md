This is a sysmodule that allows capturing the running game output to a pc via USB or network connection.

# Features
- Cross platform, can stream to Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.
- Stream via USB or Wifi.
- **Video quality is fixed to 720p @ 30fps with h264 compression, this is a hardware limit**.
- Audio quality is fixed to 16bit PCM @ 48kHz stereo. Not compressed.
- Very low latency with an optimal setup, most games are playable !

# Limitations
- **Only works on games that have video recording enabled** (aka you can long-press the capture button to save a video)
   - [There is now a workaround to support most games](https://github.com/exelix11/dvr-patches/), as it may cause issues it's hosted on a different repo and must be installed manually.
- Only captures game output. System UI, home menu and homebrews running as applet won't be captured.
- Stream quality depends heavily on the environment, bad usb wires or low wifi signal can affect it significantly.
- **USB streaming is not available when docked**
- Requires at least firmware 6.0.0

Clearly with these limitations **this sysmodule doesn't fully replace a capture card**.
