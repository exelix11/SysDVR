On windows:
Install https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
On a 32 bit windows install you'll have to find an ffmpeg dlls build (called shared build) for 32 bit and copy them in this folder, 32 bit builds are not provided offcially anymore so i'm not including them.

On linux:
Install sdl2 and ffmpeg with your package manager.
On ubuntu with apt you can use `sudo apt install ffmpeg libsdl2-dev`

On mac:
Install sdl2 and ffmpeg with brew
`brew install SDL2`
`brew install ffmpeg`
